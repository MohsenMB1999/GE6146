# GE6146 Jupyter Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for a course on geodetic remote sensing I teach (GEO ENG 6146/GEOLOGY 6341)
at Missouri University of Science and Technology. The notebooks are written in Python and can be loaded and ran in Google
Colab. The notebooks cover accessing and using GRACE gravity data, Global Navigational Satellite Systems (GNSS) data from 
UNAVCO, Interferometric Synthetic Aperature RADAR (InSAR) from the Alaska Satellite Facility and ARIA, and LiDAR data from
OpenTopography.org. 

## Note: 
some functionality based on codes in the course Google Drive may not work. Feel free to reach out to me with 
questions or requests.
