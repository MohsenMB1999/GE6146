    "# Gravity signals from GRACE for measuring ice mass loss\n",
    "In this lab we are going to analyze some data from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission and use it to estimate (1) ice mass loss from Greenland, (2) ice mass loss from Antarctica, and (3) the change in global sea level that could arise if all of the ice mass loss is due to ice melting into liquid water. You will access data from the Grace mission, import it into your Jupyter notebook on Google Colab, and plot and analyze the results. \n",

    "## A couple important points to make: \n",
    "- When you make changes this notebook, those changes are not saved in Github or anywhere else, so you need to download the notebook to save your changes. \n",
    "- You can re-upload this notebook instead of the original notebook from Github if you want to stop working and come back at another time. Just \"Download .ipynb\" and save to your desired location on your computer. Alternatively, you can save the notebook to your Google Drive and load it directly from there using Google Colab's interface with Google Drive (File - Open Notebook - select \"Google Drive\" and give Colab access to your Google Drive). You can also click on the \"Copy to Drive\" button at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "- You will need to put the GRACE data you obtain into a place that Google Colab can find it. You can do this by either directly uploading from your computer or adding your Google drive to your Colab session. Examples of how to do both are provided below.\n",
    "- **When you are finished with the notebook, make sure all the cells have run (so that all the plots show up, etc.) and then download your notebook and upload it to Canvas under the File Upload option for Homework 2.**"
